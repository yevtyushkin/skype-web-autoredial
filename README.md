### Potential Issues and Troubleshooting

#### Locale Compatibility

This extension was initially developed for personal use and primarily supports the RU locale. As a result, it may not automatically recognize the `Start` and `End` call buttons in other locales. To customize the extension for your specific locale, follow these steps:

1. **Edit Main JavaScript File**:
   - Open the `main.js` file in your preferred code editor.
2. **Update Button Titles**:
   - Modify the `START_CALL_BUTTON_TITLE` and `END_CALL_BUTTON_TITLE` constants to reflect the exact titles used in your locale.
3. **Apply Changes**:
   - Reload the extension in your browser to activate the updates.

#### Adjusting Call Durations

Depending on your needs, you might find it necessary to adjust the duration the extension waits before ending a call or the interval between calls. This is particularly useful for tailoring the autoredialing process to your specific scenario:

1. **Access Main JavaScript File**:
   - Locate and open `main.js`.
2. **Customize Time Durations**:
   - Alter the `CALL_DURATION` and/or `BETWEEN_CALLS_DURATION` constants. Note that these values are in milliseconds (ms).
3. **Apply Changes**:
   - Reload the extension in your browser to activate the updates.
